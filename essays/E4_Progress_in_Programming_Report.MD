# My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
<p></p>

# I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
<p></p>

#I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
<p></p>

#The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:

#I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
<p>Through Assignment 1, I’ve been able to see the different aspects of the course that we discussed throughout the semester and how they interconnect with each other- it’s slowly becoming full-circle! However, I wish we started with the Assignment first and worked our way through the individual Labs/WODs for each as we progressed through Assignment 1. I personally find it easier to go from a macro view to a micro view. Starting the assignment earlier would have allowed more time to work on it, in addition to progressive building/work on the assignment rather than somewhat of a sudden amalgamation of the coursework to date.I hope that Assignment 2 </p>
# I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
<p>The Zoom recordings are a great help, allowing me to focus on what Professor is conveying in the lecture rather than try to keep up with him.</p>
#What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
<p>One-on-one help from Professor and Lui and working with peers have helped me the most. Something about having a physical individual and a physical interaction helps me grasp concepts and understand them better. It allows for questions and discussion which I believe helps me gain a fuller understanding, in addition to allowing me to feel more supported/not stupid.
