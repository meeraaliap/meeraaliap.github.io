# My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
<p>My programming skills have greatly improved in several key areas. I have become more familiar with the syntax of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, as well as the underlying logic behind their implementation. This foundational knowledge has enabled me to shift my focus more towards making informed design choices. As a result, my approach to programming is becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing me to create more visually appealing and functionally effective web interfaces.</p>

# I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
<p>To further improve my programming skills, I recognize the need to enhance several aspects of my learning process. First, I need to become more adept at asking for help, which includes knowing how to frame my questions effectively and understanding exactly what to ask. Additionally, I am working on maintaining a positive outlook and not viewing challenges as personal flaws when I encounter difficulties in completing tasks. Lastly, I am focusing on making better use of available resources, such as ChatGPT and Professor Port, to support my development and provide guidance as I navigate through complex programming issues.</p>

# I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
<p>While I have learned a lot from doing Workouts of the Day (WODs), my experience has been mixed. On one hand, I have gained a better understanding of the logic side of programming through these exercises. On the other hand, the pressure to complete them under a time constraint often proved challenging. This sometimes led me to resort to using the screencast at the last minute in order to finish the exercise within the allotted time. Despite these challenges, the WODs have been a valuable learning tool, enhancing my problem-solving skills in programming.</p>

# The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
<p>The labs have been instrumental in my learning process, helping me to gain a basic understanding of key concepts and allowing me to complete them with confidence, all within a safe and nurturing environment. While the pace of the labs can sometimes be fast, making them challenging to follow at times, this supportive setting helps mitigate the pressure and encourages thorough learning.</p>

# I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
<p>My experience with Assignment 1 was highly educational, and I feel pretty prepared to tackle Assignment 2. Through the completion of Assignment 1, I was able to observe firsthand the various aspects of the course that we discussed throughout the semester and how they interconnect. This experience has helped everything come full circle, deepening my understanding of the subject matter and enhancing my readiness to engage with new challenges in the next assignment.</p>

# I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
<p>While the Zoom recordings have been incredibly helpful, as they allow me to focus more on what the professor is conveying during lectures without the pressure of trying to keep up in real time, I believe there are several ways the class could be improved to enhance my learning experience. I think starting with the assignments and then progressing through the individual Labs/WODs would be more beneficial. I find it easier to understand the course material from a macro view before diving into the details, and starting the assignments earlier would not only allow more time for completion but also facilitate a gradual build-up of knowledge, rather than a sudden convergence of course content. Moreover, increasing the ratio of practical work to lectures would provide more hands-on learning opportunities, which I believe would reinforce understanding and application of the material.</p>

# What helps me the most in this class:
<p>In my experience, the most beneficial aspects have been one-on-one help from Professor Port and Lui, along with working closely with my peers. The physical presence and direct interaction with knowledgeable individuals greatly enhance my ability to grasp and understand complex concepts. This interactive environment encourages open discussion and allows for immediate clarification of doubts, which not only deepens my understanding but also provides reassurance and support, reminding me that I am capable and not lacking in ability. Such engagements have been instrumental in fostering a more comprehensive grasp of the course material.</p>
