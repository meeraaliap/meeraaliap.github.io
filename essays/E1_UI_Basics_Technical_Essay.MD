# BrowserHistory1 Reflection
<p> For my first WOD, I was instructed to create a simple web page about the history of the web browsers Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. Additionally, to facilitate navigation, I had to create a Table of Contents section to reference the various sections within the webpage. Using proper headers, I was supposed to write an introduction, brief paragraphs on the history of each of the web browsers, incorporate 4 external links into my content and then embed the logos within their respective sections. I made three attempts to complete this WOD: the first being DNF, the second being AVG and the last being Rx. 

Recording was one of the more challenging aspects of the WOD for me because I kept stumbling over my words or mumbling when things weren’t working out. Having prior exposure to working with HTML proved to be beneficial as I worked through this WOD. My first attempt was DNF because halfway through I cut the recording because I felt I was stumbling too much. My second and third attempts reflect my understanding of the material and task more accurately. While I did manage to finish at the Rx time in my third attempt, I failed to recheck my work before submitting and missed the id names in the headings.

The major takeaways for me from this WOD were:
Stumbling is natural. 
Write out what each line does so that when recording and you get stuck, you have something to reference to get back on your train of thought. 
Don’t be overconfident, go back and check your work prior to submission.

I overall enjoyed the experience and felt that it helped me grasp the concepts more thoroughly and identify what didn’t make sense.

# BrowserHistory2 Reflection
<p> 
My second WOD required that I improve the visual appeal of my existing web page from BrowserHistory1. I linked a CSS file to my HTML so that I could edit the font, font color, margins, text width, background colors, etc.  I made two attempts, one ending in the Avg time and the second in the Rx time.

The recording front of this WOD went a lot smoother than my first. I wasn’t as particular about verbiage this time around, in addition to being more relaxed about the recording being on (I actually forgot I was recording at one point!). The main issues I faced while completing the WOD were word choice; I initially used “style” instead of “stylesheet” which caused the CSS file not to apply in my first attempt. This took me quite a while to realize because I was looking for errors in the order in which I approached the task. In my second attempt, the syntax of my “color” line was off, causing the darkblue color not to apply. Aside from these issues, the rest of the WOD came pretty naturally to me and I found the completion to be a “full-circle” moment for me because I was able to take the readings from before the start of the lab and apply/see them work in live-time and felt super accomplished afterwards. 

Key takeaway from this lab was to look for the dumb syntax errors first, then move to the deeper,lengthier issues (chances are it’s probably a syntax error) :)

# BrowserHistory3 Reflection
<p>For my third WOD, I was instructed to further improve the visual appeal and readability of my webpage. I was instructed to convert the table of contents to a horizontal navigation bar and change the layout of the content to separate the introduction and the remainder of the content into three columns (1 per browser). I made two attempts, the first falling into the Sd time and the second ending within the Rx time. 

This WOD was one of the more challenging ones for me since we made more extensive use of CSS than the last WOD. Using the CSS to rearrange the layout was something that was new to me and I faced many challenges in my first attempt, especially in regards to the use of padding. I did not realize it was an option initially and was trying to adjust the margins. Upon consulting the screencast midway through the recording, I realized that padding was a more practical, neater, and faster option. It was at this point that I realized that I should probably take the time to go through the handouts on CSS in more detail. I went through all of them before my second attempt, and found it to go by much smoother. 

The key takeaways from this lab include:
Learning to be okay with referencing the screencast after a failed/struggling attempt 
Going through the additional handouts/readings and taking notes on them to understand each of the functions available and what they can do.
