# Why Did I Choose to Pursue MIS?

This is a question I get asked a lot, especially by friends and family because I "already had two majors" and they did not see me as "the type" to pursue a rather technical subject. To be completely honest, I had not planned on the major or even taking ITM 352, until registration for the Spring 2024 semester had opened. While I wish I had a more elaboarte story or reasoning behind my decsion, the  reason I chose to take a step in pursuing the MIS major had more to do with practicality than anything else. 

Accounting being my primary major, I naturally joined Accounting Club in Spring 2023 to get a better idea of the major. As a result, I had several opportunities to network with Accounting professionals from various companies and industries. When I would ask about regrets they had or for advice they had for me (as someone considering the major), the most common responses I would get had to do with having an MIS or IT-related background. I soon began to understand the growing gap between Accountants and IT professionals, and felt the need to tailor my education in an effort to help minimize this gap in the future. It was here that the 'MIS Seed' was planted in my mind.

Fast forward a few months later, my boss put me in charge of managing the Wordpress webpages for our annual conference. I had little to no technical background, let alone any knowledge of html or css. While I took some time out to try to understand the syntax, I eventually found myself overwhelmed with the volume of resources availanle, frustrated with the lack of results I was getting, and pressed for time as the conference was approaching in the next 2-3 months. I began looking at archives and decided to use those pages as templates to formulate the new ones- a rather inefficient, time-consuming, and restrictive approach. Yet again, I saw how having technical expertise in the area would be a benefit, not just to me, but the people and organizations I work with/for. 

And so, when registration opened these discussions and experiences came to mind. I felt a strong urge to take this step in pursuing the major, not just to enhance my skillset, but also to be able to be an asset to the people and organizations I work for in the long run.
