*About Me*

I'm Aalia and I am a sophomore at Shidler. I am majoring in Accounting, Finance, and (hopefully) Management Information Systems. After living and studying between the Middle East and South Asia for a number of years, I decided to return to Oahu for my college education. When I'm not studying (yes, I consider studying as a hobby) I enjoy reading and writing poetry, photography, and more recently, pilates. 

*Career Goals*

My short term career goals currently revolve around a career in Government Accoutning within the State or Federal sectors. During this time, I hope to study for and pass my CPA exams. However, teaching is my true passion. In the long run, I would like to go back to school to pursue my PhD in Accounting and then teach at a collegiate level. 

*Guiding Belief*

Guided by the belief that confronting challenges head-on and trusting my instincts paves the way for limitless possibilities, I embrace each opportunity with enthusiasm and determination.
