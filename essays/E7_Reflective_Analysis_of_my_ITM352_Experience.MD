# 1. ITM 352 has the following goals. For each of the above goals, explain what stands out in your class experience that indicates you have met that goal.
<h3>Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context</h3>
<p>My class experience clearly demonstrates my achievement of this objective from successfully writing basic programs from scratch. This began with our initial Workouts of the Day (WODs) and continued with assignments 1 & 2. These experiences introduced me to a plethora of new concepts—ranging from for loops and functions to algorithms and cookies, and sessions. Prior to this class, I was only remotely familiar with the concepts of these elements. Through the course, I have gained hands-on exposure to them, having implemented them in the assignments and labs in order to lay solid foundations in programming and IT. A critical aspect of developing robust programming skills, as emphasized by Professor Ports, is the ability to RTFM and how to ask IT-related questions- most notably, how to ask questions to get the most precise information possible (whether it was through online searches, ChatGPT, or even just asking Professor Port a question!). </p>

<h3>Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge</h3>
<p>In ITM 352, I learned the importance of basic programming skills and knowledge for MIS professionals, which was further emphasized by the comprehensive curriculum that not only taught me programming but also prepared me to act as an effective liaison within organizations. This skill is crucial for those in MIS roles who may not be directly involved in IT but need to bridge the gap between technical teams and other departments such as marketing and accounting. Possessing both technical knowledge and soft skills allows MIS professionals to effectively communicate IT concepts and concerns to the wider organization.

This aspect of my education was particularly underscored through my interactions with Professor Port, where I gained deeper insights into technical concepts. Subsequently, I had the opportunity to explain these concepts to a fellow student, which reinforced my ability to translate complex IT ideas into understandable terms for those without a technical background. This experience highlighted the dual role MIS professionals play—understanding and communicating technical information, thereby fostering better integration and cooperation across different parts of an organization.</p>

<h3>Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications</h3>
<p>Throughout the semester, we actively engaged in designing and developing a range of business solutions that leverage IT. For example, through assignments 1 and 2, we built a functioning e-commerce website including a login and registration page, as well as generated an invoice for purchases with sales tax and subtotals included.
Each piece of these applications was built incrementally through the labs and WODs. We utilized concepts/skills like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, applying functions to improve functionality. This hands-on approach not only helped me understand the technical aspects of software development but also allowed me to apply these skills in practical, real-world scenarios.</p>

<h3>Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions</h3>
<p>Throughout the course, I faced numerous challenges; almost every assignment presented unique issues that were more often than not, not straightforward and often resulted in delays and technical faults. This required me to actively seek solutions, sometimes with guidance from the Professor and TAs, but largely through my own efforts.

For instance, I encountered a problem in assignment 2 where I was running into syntax issues and used ChatGPT to resolve them. ChatGPT ended up moving things around and put functions inside of loops that weren't supposed to be there causing my website to not load at all. I spent days trying to figure out what the issue was only to meet with Professor Port to find out the issue was placement. This experience was emblematic of the trial and error nature of our learning process, mirrored even by Professor Port, who also occasionally faced difficulties with his programs during lectures. 
</p>

<h3>Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues </h3>
<p>Throughout the semester, the importance of collaboration became clear. It was not just about working alongside peers; it was also crucial to communicate effectively with our professor. Reaching out in a timely manner and asking insightful questions were key strategies that enhanced my understanding and execution of projects.

Effective communication extended beyond just problem-solving. It fostered a collaborative environment essential for the successful completion of our projects. We learned that tackling software challenges is a collective effort, requiring diverse viewpoints to navigate complex issues.

As our assignments evolved, the significance of thoughtful design choices became evident. These decisions impacted not only the initial implementation but also the future expansion of our programs. Professor Port's emphasis on making our code more general than necessary was a guiding principle. This approach, while often more complex initially, facilitated easier modifications and enhancements down the line. </p>

<h3>Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems</h3>
<p>I not only gained confidence in addressing Management Information Systems (MIS) problems, but I also became adept at anticipating potential issues and trusting in my abilities and available resources to navigate them. This course taught me to approach challenges methodically. 
This proactive and systematic approach to problem-solving was immensely valuable during my internship, where I was tasked with learning to use an ERP system without guidance in an environment where no one was familiar with the system. The skills I developed in ITM 352 enabled me to confidently tackle this daunting task. I learned to trust in my ability to figure things out independently and to effectively utilize any resources at my disposal.
The comfort with making mistakes and navigating new technologies fostered by ITM 352 proved crucial during my internship. It empowered me to explore the ERP system deeply, leading to the discovery of new features that significantly enhanced productivity and efficiency in the office. This experience not only affirmed the value of the problem-solving techniques I had honed in ITM 352 but also enhanced my professional development and contributed to my workplace.</p>
