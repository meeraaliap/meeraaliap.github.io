# 1. ITM 352 has the following goals. For each of the above goals, explain what stands out in your class experience that indicates you have met that goal.
<h3>Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context</h3>
<p>My class experience clearly demonstrates my achievement of this objective from successfully writing basic programs from scratch. This began with our initial Workouts of the Day (WODs) and continued with assignments 1 & 2. These experiences introduced me to a plethora of new concepts—ranging from for loops and functions to algorithms and cookies, and sessions. Prior to this class, I was only remotely familiar with the concepts of these elements. Through the course, I have gained hands-on exposure to them, having implemented them in the assignments and labs in order to lay solid foundations in programming and IT. A critical aspect of developing robust programming skills, as emphasized by Professor Ports, is the ability to RTFM and how to ask IT-related questions- most notably, how to ask questions to get the most precise information possible (whether it was through online searches, ChatGPT, or even just asking Professor Port a question!). </p>

<h3>Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge</h3>
<p>In ITM 352, I learned the importance of basic programming skills and knowledge for MIS professionals, which was further emphasized by the comprehensive curriculum that not only taught me programming but also prepared me to act as an effective liaison within organizations. This skill is crucial for those in MIS roles who may not be directly involved in IT but need to bridge the gap between technical teams and other departments such as marketing and accounting. Possessing both technical knowledge and soft skills allows MIS professionals to effectively communicate IT concepts and concerns to the wider organization.

This aspect of my education was particularly underscored through my interactions with Professor Port, where I gained deeper insights into technical concepts. Subsequently, I had the opportunity to explain these concepts to a fellow student, which reinforced my ability to translate complex IT ideas into understandable terms for those without a technical background. This experience highlighted the dual role MIS professionals play—understanding and communicating technical information, thereby fostering better integration and cooperation across different parts of an organization.</p>

<h3>Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications</h3>
<p>Throughout the semester, we actively engaged in designing and developing a range of business solutions that leverage IT. For example, through assignments 1 and 2, we built a functioning e-commerce website including a login and registration page, as well as generated an invoice for purchases with sales tax and subtotals included.
Each piece of these applications was built incrementally through the labs and WODs. We utilized concepts/skills like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, applying functions to improve functionality. This hands-on approach not only helped me understand the technical aspects of software development but also allowed me to apply these skills in practical, real-world scenarios.</p>

<h3>Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions</h3>
<p>Throughout the course, I faced numerous challenges; almost every assignment presented unique issues that were more often than not, not straightforward and often resulted in delays and technical faults. This required me to actively seek solutions, sometimes with guidance from the Professor and TAs, but largely through my own efforts.

For instance, I encountered a problem in assignment 2 where I was running into syntax issues and used ChatGPT to resolve them. ChatGPT ended up moving things around and put functions inside of loops that weren't supposed to be there causing my website to not load at all. I spent days trying to figure out what the issue was only to meet with Professor Port to find out the issue was placement. This experience was emblematic of the trial and error nature of our learning process, mirrored even by Professor Port, who also occasionally faced difficulties with his programs during lectures. 
</p>

<h3>Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues </h3>
<p>Throughout the semester, the importance of collaboration became clear. It was not just about working alongside peers; it was also crucial to communicate effectively with our professor. Reaching out in a timely manner and asking insightful questions were key strategies that enhanced my understanding and execution of projects.

Effective communication extended beyond just problem-solving. It fostered a collaborative environment essential for the successful completion of our projects. We learned that tackling software challenges is a collective effort, requiring diverse viewpoints to navigate complex issues.

As our assignments evolved, the significance of thoughtful design choices became evident. These decisions impacted not only the initial implementation but also the future expansion of our programs. Professor Port's emphasis on making our code more general than necessary was a guiding principle. This approach, while often more complex initially, facilitated easier modifications and enhancements down the line. </p>

<h3>Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems</h3>
<p>I not only gained confidence in addressing Management Information Systems (MIS) problems, but I also became adept at anticipating potential issues and trusting in my abilities and available resources to navigate them. This course taught me to approach challenges methodically. 
This proactive and systematic approach to problem-solving was immensely valuable during my internship, where I was tasked with learning to use an ERP system without guidance in an environment where no one was familiar with the system. The skills I developed in ITM 352 enabled me to confidently tackle this daunting task. I learned to trust in my ability to figure things out independently and to effectively utilize any resources at my disposal.
The comfort with making mistakes and navigating new technologies fostered by ITM 352 proved crucial during my internship. It empowered me to explore the ERP system deeply, leading to the discovery of new features that significantly enhanced productivity and efficiency in the office. This experience not only affirmed the value of the problem-solving techniques I had honed in ITM 352 but also enhanced my professional development and contributed to my workplace.</p>

# 2. Course Elements and Personal Engagement
<h2> What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352? </h2>
<p>Creating a professional portfolio in ITM 352 was an invaluable learning experience that emphasized the importance of showcasing and critically reflecting on my work. I learned to analyze my successes and shortcomings critically, enabling me to identify lessons from my mistakes and ensure they were not repeated. Proper documentation of these processes and outcomes was also crucial. It served as a detailed record of my development, illustrating not just what I had accomplished, but how I had evolved as a learner and problem solver over time. It was through reflecting on previous assignments and WODs that I realized that preemptively commenting on my code allowed me to outline my thoughts and objectives before diving into the coding itself. By establishing a clear roadmap at the beginning, I ensured that I didn't lose track of my initial intentions and had a reference point to return to if needed.
The act of maintaining a professional portfolio, became a tool for continuous improvement and professional growth. It highlighted the importance of a structured approach to work, from planning through to reflection, and reinforced the value of a portfolio as a showcase of both skills and learning processes.</p>
<h2> What did you gain from doing the WODs?</h2>
<p>Participating in the Workouts of the Day (WODs) in this course provided me with valuable experience in managing time pressures and performing under observation. These exercises not only reinforced the importance of efficiency but also enhanced my ability to articulate my thought process while actively engaging in a task. Additionally, the WODs served as a practical application of the concepts learned in labs, solidifying my understanding and boosting my confidence in my ability to execute tasks within a specified timeframe.</p>
<h2>Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?</h2>
<p>Personally, I would say no. I only truly began to grasp and understand the concepts presented when I engaged with the material hands-on in the labs, and then applied it again in the Workouts of the Day (WODs) and other assignments. I felt that the quizzes often took time away from the WODs and assignments, which were, at least in my experience, more helpful and insightful than the quizzes. I think the quizzes served as an initial step, but the deeper comprehension and practical application only came through active experimentation and application in more dynamic settings.</p>
<h2>What did you learn from doing the labs?</h2>
<p>The necessity to anticipate problems was a recurrent theme, as even Professor Port often encountered issues during the labs. This experience underscored that problem-solving in this field is typically a collaborative effort, requiring teamwork to navigate and resolve challenges. Furthermore, I realized the importance of thoroughly reading and understanding documentation. Many of the challenges in MIS can be addressed more effectively with a deep dive into the relevant documentation, highlighting the need for meticulous study and research skills. Additionally, I learned to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) as a powerful tool in problem-solving. The key to effectively using AI lies in asking precise and pertinent questions. This skill enables the AI to provide the specific answers needed, thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy in tackling complex issues. </p>
<h2>What did you learn from doing the essays?</h2>
<p>From writing and reading essays in this course, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of reflection in the learning process. These essays helped me understand that learning to program is an ongoing journey, varying significantly from one individual to another. It was enlightening and reassuring to read about the challenges my peers faced and the diverse strategies they employed to overcome them. This not only broadened my perspective but also fostered a sense of unity and solidarity among us. Amidst the stress and challenges of learning complex programming concepts, sharing our experiences through essays created a supportive community environment, emphasizing that while our approaches may differ, we are all navigating the same turbulent waters together.</p>
<h2>What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?</h2>
<p>From completing Assignments 1 and 2, I acquired significant technical skills and deepened my understanding of web development concepts. These projects taught me how to manipulate query strings to facilitate the transfer of information between web pages. I also grasped the critical importance of distinguishing between client-side and server-side processing, especially concerning the handling of sensitive information like passwords, and implementing enhanced security measures.

Furthermore, I learned how to effectively utilize web templates from resources such as W3 Schools, which significantly improved my ability to style and structure web pages professionally using CSS. These assignments not only reinforced the skills we practiced throughout the semester but also allowed me to apply them in a practical context.

On a broader educational level, these projects underscored the ineffectiveness of cramming and highlighted the importance of continuous learning. The progressive nature of IT and programming means that each new concept builds upon the previous ones. A lack of understanding in one area can lead to compounded difficulties as the course progresses. This realization stressed the necessity of maintaining a steady pace in learning and addressing gaps in knowledge promptly.</p>

# 3. Challenges and Achievements
<h2> Detail the specific challenges you encountered during the course, such as understanding new programming concepts, completing WODs, web application development assignments.</h2>
<p>Throughout this course, I faced numerous challenges, each contributing significantly to my learning curve. One particular challenge I recall vividly was writing proper functions and truly understanding their operation. I found that if I could articulate what each part of my function was doing—such as explaining the steps within a loop or what each variable was meant to store—I gained a deeper understanding of my code. This ability to verbally explain my code line by line was not just a technical skill but a marker of true comprehension, which was initially a struggle. As the course progressed, I increasingly relied on AI to assist with coding, which presented its own set of challenges in understanding the underlying logic of what I was implementing and ensuring that AI was giving me the relevant code for the task at hand became increasingly difficult, especially with my knowledge gaps.
The time constraints imposed by the Workouts of the Day (WODs) posed another significant challenge. Completing these timed exercises, often ranging from 15 minutes to an hour, was always a rush against the clock. The final WOD was particularly daunting as it required us to revisit and modify a previous lab without prior edits. Dealing with aspects like CSS issues under such pressure was not only frustrating but also a real test of my ability to apply what I had learned quickly and effectively. These experiences, fraught with difficulty, were crucial in enhancing my problem-solving skills and technical proficiency.</p>
<h2>Explain how you overcame these challenges and the strategies that helped you succeed.</h2>
<p> I overcame these challenges by adopting a few key strategies that significantly improved my approach to problem-solving. Initially, spending time to thoroughly read and understand the necessary concepts before attempting implementation proved immensely helpful. This preparatory step was crucial whenever I faced an issue I didn't understand or was unsure how to approach.

Reaching out to Professor Port was also instrumental in navigating these obstacles. He helped me deconstruct each problem into more manageable parts, providing a broader perspective on the issues at hand. His guidance not only clarified the technical aspects but also helped me grasp the overall scope and context of the tasks, which enhanced my understanding and approach.

Additionally, Professor Port's support was a significant morale booster. Knowing I had reliable guidance available made it easier to tackle challenges with confidence and maintain my motivation throughout the course.</p>
<h2>Highlight any particular achievements or milestones in the course that were significant to you.</h2>
<p>
Working with Professor Port for the first time marked a significant milestone for me, especially because I initially struggled to ask questions and seek guidance when I needed it. The moment I gathered the courage to reach out to him was transformative. I remember admitting that I didn't understand what was wrong or even how to articulate my questions. His reassurance that it was okay not to know everything was a relief. He also guided me on how to familiarize myself with the issues and phrase my questions more effectively, which was incredibly helpful.

Another significant milestone occurred while working on Assignment 1 under his guidance. It was during this time that I really began to understand how design choices could impact the rest of my work. We explored various approaches to implementing my individual requirement before settling on one particular method. Initially, I was perplexed by his suggestions, but as we progressed, I began to comprehend his reasoning. I even started to identify errors and make corrections on my own while he observed. One of the most rewarding aspects of this experience was seeing Professor Port's excitement as I started to grasp the concepts and work independently. This encouragement and the skills I developed during these interactions were particularly meaningful achievements in my learning journey.</p>

# 4. Skill Development and Application (*ChatGPT was used in these responses)
<h2>Reflect on the three skill levels outlined in the course (syntactic, algorithmic, application) and discuss your progression through these levels.</h2>
<p><b>Syntactic Level:</b> This is the foundational level where a programmer learns the basic syntax and structure of a programming language. It involves understanding how to write code that is syntactically correct and can be compiled or interpreted by a computer. At this stage, the focus is on learning the rules and grammar of the language, akin to learning how to construct sentences in a new language.</p>
<p><b>Reflection:</b>From struggling with even basic CSS and HTML syntax, to being able to recall and switch between the two without much thought/referencing materials or ChatGPT, I’d like to think I’ve progressed in this area. I am now able to troubleshoot and identify syntax errors in code and find ways to address them- occasionally, taking help from ChatGPT to do so. While I admit progress has been made, I’d also like to acknowledge that I feel like learning syntax is an ongoing process- you think you know it all, until you need to do something that involves something you don’t know how to do:) But fortunately, I think syntax is the easiest of the stages to address, acquire, and learn. </p> 
<p><b>Algorithmic Level:</b> Once the syntax is understood, the next stage is the algorithmic level, where programmers learn how to logically solve problems through coding. This involves understanding algorithms, data structures, and how to effectively implement solutions using the programming language. The programmer learns to think in terms of step-by-step procedures to manipulate data and produce desired outcomes.<p>
<p><b>Reflection:</b> This stage was only slightly more challenging for me than syntax since the concepts weren’t mere semi-colons, quotations, and backticks- demanding relatively more time and cognitive thought to comprehend and process. I still struggle with some concepts, like conditionals, but I feel that the more I worked with them, the firmer my foundation became. At times I wish I had more time to be able to dedicate myself to understanding them thoroughly so that I could make better use of them in my assignments.</p>
<p><b>Application Level:</b> At this level, the focus shifts from individual algorithms and data structures to building complete applications. Programmers learn how to integrate different parts of a software system, manage larger codebases, and use external libraries and frameworks. The skills at this level include understanding software architecture, design patterns, and how different components work together to create functional software.</p>
<p><b>Reflection:</b> This was most definitely the most difficult stage for me, particularly as an overthinker. Concepts like functions and conditionals proved challenging for me to grasp, but even more challenging for me to know when they best fit the demands of the situation at hand and implement accordingly. There were often multiple ways to do things and my mind would get caught up in thinking about all the different ways a task could be accomplished, so I often had a hard time sticking to an approach once I committed to it. Professor Port’s constant reminders to keep it simple and “do the right thing, rather than the fastest thing” helped me stay on-track at times, but more often than not, I found myself overcomplicating things. In hindsight, I think having a more thorough understanding of the various data structures would have helped me be more efficient and less indecisive.</p>
<p><b>System Level:</b> The highest level involves understanding and manipulating complex system interactions within and beyond the software environment. This includes considerations of network communications, concurrency, scaling, and security. At the system level, the programmer needs to consider how the application interacts with hardware, other applications, and various operating environments. This level requires a holistic view of technology and its ecosystem.</p>
<p><b>Reflection:</b> As an overthinker, I think these areas came to me more naturally than the actual application/implementation of them. I often had concerns regarding password security and ensuring the validity of user-inputs (since guards were not permitted in Assignment 1) in my mind. However, it was the actual addressing of these shortcomings that I found most challenging, and I attribute it to my lack of a thorough understanding of the structures from the application level. I believe that dedicating more time and effort to practicing and working with the concepts would have helped me solidify my understanding immensely.</p>

<h2>Describe how the hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications enhanced your understanding and confidence in handling MIS issues.</h2>
<p>My hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications in ITM 352 significantly enhanced my understanding and confidence in addressing MIS challenges. Through practical simulations and independent problem-solving, I developed skills crucial for navigating real-world scenarios, such as my internship where I independently optimized an unfamiliar ERP system. This experience affirmed my ability to adapt and excel, improving office productivity through strategic innovations. Further, my journey from struggling with basic CSS and HTML syntax to tackling complex system-level interactions underscores a profound growth in both my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. This holistic development not only prepared me to manage MIS issues effectively but also reinforced a resilient work ethic for future professional challenges.</p>

# 5. Use of AI (e.g. ChatGPT)
<h2> Discuss how use of AI enhanced your learning and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI effectively.</h2>
<p>AI significantly boosted my learning and productivity by providing detailed examples and explanations that improved various aspects of my code and suggested enhancements for better performance. Sometimes when I’d forget to comment my code, ChatGPT proved beneficial in helping me understand what the different loops and lines of code were doing in my labs/assignments and regain my train of thought. It was also particularly helpful in addressing syntax issues (...until it was not, I’ll explain this in the next part). As an avid user, my favorite thing to do with it was summarize the readings and extract key concepts. I’d spend 1-2 hours just asking it questions about the material to better understand core concepts (and initially, syntax). </p>
<h2>Discuss how use of AI inhibited your learning or and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI ineffectively.</h2>
<p>So back to using it for syntax, in assignment 2, I ran into syntax issues I was having a hard time resolving. I asked ChatGPT to correct the syntax. ChatGPT ended up not only correcting  the syntax but also moving things around and putting functions into loops that weren’t supposed to be there. I had not realized this initially and my whole website stopped working. After which I immediately met with Professor Port for advice, only to realize what had happened. We proceeded to have a lengthy discussion about how I needed to be more careful when using it and careful to double-check the outputs and ensure everything I initially gave it was returned to me before deleting what I had initially. It was through this experience that I really understood the importance of knowing enough about the data structures and being more explicit and specific when asking ChatGPT to help me with something. A part of me wishes we had explored these issues more in class so that we could be more alert and efficient when using it to help us in out assignments (since its use permitted in the course).</p>
