# WOD: Invoice 1
<p> For the Invoice 1 WOD, I was instructed to generate a sales invoice; making use of variables instead of hardcoding values. Moreover, the sales invoice was to include a pre-tax subtotal, the sales tax amount, and the grand total. For the specifics, please see the original instructions here. <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html"_blank">link</a></p> 

# Reflection
<p> Having gotten over the perfectionism issues I was struggling with in the first several WODs and Labs, the actual recording process went quite smoothly- taking only 2 attempts (due to DNF-ing the first one). I noticed I wasn't as hung up over minor details like going quiet for a few minutes, stumbling over my words every now and then, or even the sound of my voice in the mic (as I had an allergy flare up the night I was recording it). Ironically,despite the fact it took me several hours to complete it, I felt quite accomplished after this WOD. 

This time, the issues I faced were largely technical. I was having an extremely difficult time trying to get the table to display the data inside it. Most of my issues ended up being syntax issues. However, it was through this WOD that I also realized my understanding of "document.write()" and the different quotes used when referencing Javascript was unclear. For some reason, I was under the impression that "document.write()" hardcoded values, and so I was confused how/why I was supposed to reference the variables that we had defined earlier. 

When I went through the readings again and consulted ChatGPT for further clarification on certain areas, I finally understood that "document.write()" <b> DID NOT</b> hardcode values and that in fact, was the opposite. I now understand that "document.write()" is used to dynamically generates table content based on the predefined JavaScript variables. It allows us to display data that is not known until runtime,such as inventory items, prices, quantities from a database, or a user's input wihtout having to alter the structure of the code itself. Once this was clear to me, and I read up on the syntax once more, the WOD was significantly easier to complete.</p>

# Key Takeaways for Future WODs
The major takeaways for me from this WOD were:
<p>It is important to not only go through the readings prior to classtime, but to also have comprehended them. There were some that flew over my head when I first read them, but I thought it would make sense once we discussed/did the lab in class so I didn't spend as much time as I should've trying to comprehend them.</p>
<p><b><i> for future, I will try to take my time with the readings and clarify any "problem areas" with Professor Port or ChatGPT, rather than waiting until the WOD to realize something didn't quite click. This comparatively proactive approach, will save me a lot of time and last minute panic.</i></b></p>

<p>Not waiting till the last minute to attempt the WOD for the first time. I find the time aspect (i.e. needing to complete it in a certain timerame) of the WODs to be quite anxiey inducing for me. I never feel like I am ready and hence, keep putting it off until I am down the wire (last 2-3 hours). It's not that I don't touch them at all (I've usually read through the WOD instructions and have thought out my approach to the solution), but moreso I begin to question my approach and the issues I may encounter and try to trouble-shoot in advance so that I "don't waste time" while recording.</p>
<p><b><i>for future, I will start the WODs the night we have covered the material needed to attempt it. This would not only help with time management and give me a larger window to work on the WOD, but also help me catch any problem areas sooner than later, which would also give me the oppsotunity to raise it with Professor Port or my classmates in advance of the deadline.</i></b></p>

<p>The importance of keeping up with the course. I fell behind in theses last few modules because of ongoing health issues and issues with time management as a result. I realize how interdependent the labs/WODs are and how missing one means missing others for weeks on end; not to mention how quickly the work piles up. Over this long weekend, I hope to catch up and possibly get ahead to allow for instances where I may not have as much time, or not be in the best of health.</p> 
<p><b><i>I know I cannot plan for health issues, but I believe that by consistently trying to be a little ahead on things, I'll avoid instances where the amount of work to do is overwhelming. I'd like to think that if the work left to do were minimal or menial, even if I wasn't well, I'd still be able to get it done since "the majority is done." </i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>While this course is challenging me on so many levels and so many areas, I know that I am gaining more than just technical knowledge out of this course. Rather, I feel that on a personal level at least, I am gaining a lot of valuable expereince regarding time management and am building my resilience. I hope that by the end of the course, I am able to say that I am a lot stronger of an indiviudal than I was when I walked in.</i></p>
