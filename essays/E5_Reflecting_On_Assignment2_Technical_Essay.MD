# Assignment 2 Overview
<p>This assignment involves enhancing a website by adding user registration and login features, enabling personalized user experiences post-login. The key tasks include securely storing user data and using it for login verification, improving the user interface for better navigation and error handling, and implementing security measures like password encryption and case-sensitive validations.For more information, please see here.</p>

# What did you learn from this assignment?
<p>This project was a deep dive into web application development, concentrating particularly on the management and security of user data. It offered me crucial insights into how to manage user registration and login processes securely, underscoring the significance of maintaining persistent data and implementing strong security protocols. A particularly challenging but rewarding aspect was handling user sessions without relying on conventional cookies or session management techniques, providing a distinctive educational experience in this field of web development.</p>

# Did you work with a partner?
<p>No, I opted to work on my own, of course, under the guidance of Professor Port:)</p>

# How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
<p>Professor Port's guidance was crucial to my project, especially his recommendations on managing invalid user inputs. He advised placing error messages directly beneath the relevant input fields, like the email or full name, to explicitly communicate the specific requirements to users. This method highlighted the importance of deeply understanding and modifying the code beyond just copying from sources such as ChatGPT. It stressed the necessity to identify which code segments are relevant and how to strategically implement them for maximum effectiveness.</p>

# How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
<p>Assignment 2 represented a substantial evolution from the basic concepts covered in Assignment 1, requiring a deeper grasp of essential web application functions. This more advanced stage concentrated on user authentication methods, effective data storage strategies, and crafting personalized user interactions. Moving away from the basic web design principles of the first assignment, this phase highlighted the critical need for strong security measures and sophisticated data management, thus raising the project's technical demands and complexity.</p>

# Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
<p><b>a)</b>60% thinking</p>
<p><b>b)</b>20% coding</p>
<p><b>c)</b>20% debugging</p>

# Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
<p>The development of my login page was a successful component of the project, achieving its primary goals smoothly. However, I faced challenges in validating user input and displaying error messages effectively. These issues required careful attention to ensure that users received clear and immediate feedback on any input errors, enhancing the overall user experience and functionality of the page.</p>

# If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
<p>Looking back on the project, if I had the chance to do it over, I would start sooner and tackle the requirements with a more logical approach, instead of overanalyzing them, which would have saved a significant amount of time. Furthermore, I would devote more effort to fulfilling extra Individual Requirements (IRs) to earn additional credit.</p>
