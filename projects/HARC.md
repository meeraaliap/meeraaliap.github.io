Conceived in 2016, HARC stands for the Hawaii Accounting Research Conference. HARC is an annual accounting research conference hosted by the School of Accountancy (SOA) on Jan 3, 4, and 5. It serves as a platform for accounting researchers from all over the world to present,discuss, and gain feedback on their research work.
